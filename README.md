# Advent-of-code

### Solutions for each year I participate in Advent of code

- In 2022 I chose to solve the problems using Python
- In 2023 my plan is to use Rust

Since I use these problems mostly for practice and I'm not too strict in terms of efficiency and style,
if there is any suggestion you would like to give feel free to make a PR.
